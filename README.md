# Project Title: Convolution and Parameter Tuning with Distortion Matrix and Max Pooling



## **Overview**

This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the task of digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset contains images of handwritten digits, which are used to train the model to recognize and classify them accurately. Our CNN achieved an impressive **accuracy of 95.8%** on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in this image classification task.

## **1. Data Preparation and Preprocessing**

The initial step involves preparing and preprocessing the data to make it suitable for training a neural network. The key steps in this phase are:

- **Data Loading:** The MNIST dataset is loaded, consisting of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), each associated with a label indicating the digit it represents.

- **Data Splitting:** The dataset is split into training and test sets. The training set is utilized for model training, while the test set is reserved for evaluating the model's performance on unseen data.

- **Normalization:** Pixel values are normalized from a range of 0 to 255 to a range of 0 to 1. Normalization speeds up the training process and improves the model's convergence.

- **Label Encoding:** Labels are converted into a one-hot encoded format, which is crucial for multi-class classification. This encoding represents each digit as a binary vector, where only the index of the actual digit is 1, and all other entries are 0.

- **Batching:** The data is organized into batches, which helps in efficient computation and gradient estimation during model training.

## **2. CNN Architecture Design**

The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture used in this project is inspired by the classic LeNet-5 architecture, which is known for its effectiveness in image recognition tasks. The key components of this architecture include:

- **Input Layer:** The input layer processes images of size 28x28 pixels. The images are reshaped to include a channel dimension, resulting in an input shape of (28, 28, 1) for grayscale images.

- **Convolutional Layers:**
  - Two convolutional layers are employed to detect features such as edges, textures, and patterns.
  - The first convolutional layer uses 32 filters of size 5x5, producing 32 feature maps from the input image.
  - An activation function, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), is applied to introduce non-linearity and allow the model to learn complex patterns.
  - The second convolutional layer utilizes 64 filters of size 5x5, further refining the features extracted from the first layer.

- **Pooling Layers:**
  - Max pooling layers follow each convolutional layer to reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps (downsampling), thereby lowering computational complexity and reducing overfitting.
  - The pooling operation selects the maximum value from each region covered by the filter, effectively reducing the dimensionality while retaining significant features.

- **Fully Connected Layers (Dense Layers):**
  - The output from the convolutional and pooling layers is flattened into a single vector and fed into fully connected layers.
  - The first fully connected layer consists of 1024 neurons, utilizing a ReLU activation function to interpret high-level features extracted by the convolutional layers.
  - Dropout is applied to prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of the input units to 0 during training.
  - The final fully connected layer contains 10 neurons corresponding to the 10 digit classes (0-9), representing the predicted probabilities for each class.

- **Output Layer:**
  - The output layer employs a softmax activation function, converting raw output scores into probabilities, where the digit with the highest probability is chosen as the predicted class.

## **3. Model Training**

- **Loss Function:** The model is trained using a cross-entropy loss function, suitable for multi-class classification problems. This loss function measures the dissimilarity between the true labels and the predicted probabilities.

- **Optimizer:** The model is optimized using either Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with momentum or the Adam optimizer, which dynamically adjusts the learning process, leading to faster convergence and more efficient training.

- **Training Loop:** The model is trained over multiple epochs, where the entire training dataset is passed through the model in batches, and model weights are updated based on computed gradients. Loss and accuracy metrics are monitored during training to track performance.

## **4. Model Evaluation and Visualization**

- **Evaluation on Test Set:** After training, the model is evaluated on the test set to measure its generalization performance. The accuracy on the test set provides an estimate of how well the model performs on unseen data.

- **Visualization of Learned Filters:** The script includes visualizations of the filters (kernels) learned by the convolutional layers, providing insights into the types of features (edges, textures, patterns) the model has learned to recognize.

- **Visualization of Feature Maps:** Feature maps, which are outputs of the convolutional layers after applying filters, are visualized for a sample input image. This helps understand how different filters activate for different parts of the image and provides a deeper understanding of the internal workings of the CNN.

## **5. Prediction and Submission**

- **Prediction on New Data:** The trained model is used to make predictions on new, unseen test data. The output probabilities are converted into class labels, providing the final predictions.

- **Submission Preparation:** The predictions are formatted as required for submission to a competition platform like Kaggle.

## **Conclusion**

The approach outlined in this project, using a well-structured Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, resulted in achieving a high accuracy of **95.8%** on the MNIST digit recognition task. By combining convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, fully connected layers for decision-making, and appropriate preprocessing steps, the model effectively learned from the MNIST dataset and generalized well to new data. This project demonstrates the effectiveness of CNNs in image classification tasks and showcases key machine learning practices, including data preprocessing, model architecture design, training, evaluation, and result visualization.
